=================================================
Upgrading SemanticScuttle from a previous version
=================================================

.. contents::

From version 0.94-0.98.1 to 0.98.3
==================================
Run ``scripts/fix-unfiled-tags.php`` to fix old bookmarks that miss the
``system:unfiled`` tags.


From version 0.97 to 0.98
=========================
Database updates
----------------
Apply ``data/schema/6.sql``

    ALTER TABLE `sc_users` ADD `privateKey` VARCHAR(33) NULL;
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX `privateKey` ON `sc_users` (`privateKey`);


From version 0.96 to 0.97
=========================
No database changes necessary.


From version 0.95 to 0.96
=========================
Database updates
----------------
Apply ``data/schema/5.sql``

API
---
The method signatures of ``addBookmark()`` and ``updateBookmark()``
changed due to the addition of the ``$short`` parameter.

We got complaints about the changed file structure, and people told
us that they just cannot set the document root to ``www/``, because they
are not admins on their HTTP server. This is a valid point, and
with 0.96.0 you can easily change it. See `INSTALL.txt`_ for more information
about moving ``www/``.

.. _INSTALL.txt: INSTALL.html


From version 0.94 to 0.95
=========================
The file structure completely changed in 0.95.0 compared
to previous versions. We recommend that you start with a
fresh installation, just copying over your ``config.php`` file.
Set your web server document root directory to ``www/``.

Yes, we kind of lost the ability to run SemanticScuttle
in a subdirectory of a hostname. This functionality will
be back in one of the next releases, but for now, you have
to live with it.

Update your database
--------------------
Apply ``data/schema/4.sql``.

Currently, only MySQL can be used as database backend.
All other DBMS (database management systems) have not been
tested except for PostgreSQL, and SemanticScuttle fails there.

Translation
-----------
The ``de_AT`` translation has been re-added. This is because
``de_AT`` provides a rather ugly "official German" style,
while the normal ``de_DE`` is friendlier. Choose what you like.


From version 0.93 to 0.94
=========================

- Nothing changed except for the default configuration file.
  It is recommended to start with a fresh config file,
  but not neccesary. Old config files still work.
- If you used translation ``de_AT``, please switch to ``de_DE``.
  ``de_AT`` was moved to ``de_DE`` and ``de_AT`` has been removed.


From version 0.92 to 0.93
=========================

- Backup your database
- Make a copy from your SemanticScuttle Web directory
- Upgrade your current configuration file (``config.inc.php``) with respect to ``config.inc.php.example`` ::

  $footerMessage      = ''; #HTML message appearing at the bottom of the page (just above SemanticScuttle credits)
  $sidebarTopMessage  = ''; #HTML message appearing at the top of the sidebar
  $sidebarBottomMessage = ''; #HTML message appearing at the bottom of the sidebar
  $adminsCanModifyBookmarksFromOtherUsers = true;  # 'true' if admin users can edit or delete bookmarks belonging to other users. Else 'false'.
  $adminsAreAdvisedTagsFromOtherAdmins = false;  # 'true' if tags from other admins are proposed to each admin (in add/edit a bookmark page). Else 'false'.
  $defaultPerPageForAdmins = 20; # default number of bookmarks per page for admins (-1 means no limit)


From version 0.91 to 0.92
