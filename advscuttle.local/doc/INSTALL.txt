============================
SemanticScuttle installation
============================


Prerequisites
=============
To run SemanticScuttle, you need:

- PHP5 with filter functions enabled
- A web server, for example Apache


Installation instructions
=========================
1. Create a new MySQL database
2. Import ``data/tables.sql`` into that database, i.e.
   run ::

   $ mysql -umyusername semanticscuttle < data/tables.sql

   on the shell ("semanticscuttle" being the database name)

3. Copy ``data/config.php.dist`` to ``data/config.php`` and modify it as
   necessary. See configuration_ for more information.
4. Make the cache directory writable by your web server.
   For example, run ::

   $ chmod 0777 cache

   on the shell.
5. Set the ``www/`` directory as document root in your web server,
   restart the web server.
6. That's all! Visit your SemanticScuttle installation web site now
   with your browser.
7. Register a user and add bookmarks.

Ugly www directory in URLs
==========================
In case point 5 of the installation instructions cannot be put into
practice by you because you are not able to change the web server
configuration, you are not lost! There is a way to get rid of
``www/`` in your URL!

Imagine following directory layout: ::

 /home/customer123/
   www/
     subdomain1/
     subdomain2/
     subdomain3/

Create a SemanticScuttle directory somewhere outside ``www`` if possible
and put all directories except ``www/`` in there. Move all files and
directories from ``www/`` into your subdomain directory. Then modify
``subdomain/www-header.php`` to include the correct file path.

The new directory layout should look that way: ::

 /home/customer123/
   semanticscuttle/
     doc/
     data/
     src/
   www/
     subdomain1/
     subdomain2/ (this is the semanticscuttle subdomain)
       about.php
       admin.php
       ..
       www-header.php
     subdomain3/

Now open www-header.php and replace ::

  require_once '../src/SemanticScuttle/header.php';

with ::

  require_once '../../semanticscuttle/src/SemanticScuttle/header.php';
